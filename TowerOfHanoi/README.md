Towers of Hanoi by Sergey

I'm going to have boards in my dictionary that represent the poles. I then have ints stacks that represent the rings 
or disks that have to be moved from board to board. I then have if and if else letting the player know what to do and 
if he made a mistake alerting them when they win. Using a do while checkwin to check if the player wins. the if and if
else outside of do while is the method for true and false for inaccurate inputs. and my final method refreshes the 
board every turn.
